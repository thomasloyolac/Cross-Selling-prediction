# Cross-Selling-prediction
Cross selling is selling complimentary Product or Service for our existing customers, because we already had large customer base and good relationship with them
In this Case, A Health insurance company decided to provide vehicle insurance to thier customers 
my job is to predict ,from the past customers how many of them are intrested in buying the vehicle insurance so the company can apporoach the intrested customers first
at the end 94% of the customers are correctly classified by my model
